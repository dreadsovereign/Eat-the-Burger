# Eat the Burger

A Burger Eating Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Materialize

## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end using HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework. The backend uses Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.


The user enters the name of the burger to add it to the menu. Doing this also adds it to the MySQL database. After this, the burger will appear on the left side of the screen. The user then "eats" the burger by clicking on the name of the burger, which will move it to the right-hand side of the screen, which will then update its status in the database.
